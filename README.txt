pdfTool is a basic tool to edit pdf documents.
I started it to give me a free alternative to paid or online services, with which I am not comfortable with because of sensitive documents.
This tool is most likely obsolete, but I wanted to make one myself :)

It is based on the Python library PyPdf4.
Their Github: https://github.com/claird/PyPDF4

I run it in Python 3.9, it should be compatible with all Versions, which are compatible with PyPdf4.

Common errors/tips:
	When copying paths of files from Windows Explorer, they come with "[path]", the " have to be removed.
	Paths can be either absolute or relative to the Python File.
